# Repository of the project Finance Hub + Giant Steps

We were selected to participate in a project with Giant Steps (brazillian fund) to evaluate the volatility in different times in one day. So we projected
a database and applied a linear regression model using dummies for each time of the open market. Then we applied the same method to understand how Cupom meetings affect
the volatility too.
